Use this tool to convert links from the list of embeddable sites to create a custom embed on DevTo blogs.

This is a tool that is essentially a reskin of the [GIPHY Linker](https://github.com/reprodev/GIPHY-Linker) this time adding the code required around links to create a custom embed on DevTo blogs from the list found here [DevTo Editor Guide](https://dev.to/p/editor_guide)

Included in the UI is a handy button called "Supported Sites" where you can use the full URL to embed content directly into your DevTo blog.

## Instructions

1. Download and run the DevToEmbedder.PS1 file

2. Go to one of the sites found in the custom embed section on this page [DevTo Editor Guide](https://dev.to/p/editor_guide) or use the inbuilt button
